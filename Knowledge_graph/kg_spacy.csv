55,,cheap  money,are,But there are some cheap solutions to try to save money.
56,where  you,simple  bills,looked at,We've looked at where you are likely to be losing the most energy in your home and come up with some simple solutions to help save money on your bills and keep warm this winter.
57,Warm  air,nook,wants,Warm air wants to leave your home and will find any nook and cranny to do so.
58,cold  air,draughts,sucked in,"As it does, cold air is sucked in to replace it, causing draughts."
59,home,energy,makes,It makes your home cold and wastes energy.
60,that,money,be,Shutting doors and closing windows may not be enough as any gaps in the frames allow warm air to escape - and that costs money.
61,thermal  draughts,front  door,show,"On this thermal image, the draughts show up as the coldest areas around a front door."
62,where  heat,thermal  imaging,says,"The coolest temperatures are black, purple and blue and the draughts are shown around the door in these colours, says James Richardson, of IRT Surveys - which uses thermal imaging to help home owners identify where heat is being lost."
63,so escape it,hot escape air,appears warm,"The letter box, often an escape route for hot air, appears warm (red and yellow colours) so it is likely to be well-sealed and insulated."
64,saving  one,draught  excluder,agree,"But by simply adding a draught excluder - or even a rolled up towel - the draughts can be blocked, as we can see in these before and after images:Energy firms and energy-saving campaigners agree one of the simplest solutions to keeping out the cold is to use a draught excluder."
65,draught it,year  bills,help,"Combined with draught-proofing of windows and doors, it could help cut around £25 a year off your bills."
66,attractive household you,always  one,be,"Having a rolled-up towel by the front door may not be the most attractive household feature, but you can always try to make and decorate one yourself."
67,draught  excluder,door,is important,It is important to make sure the draught excluder covers the width of the door.
68,,discarded trouser leg,use,"And for a no-sew method, use strips of the discarded material to make ties and tie up each end of the trouser leg instead."
69,you,similar  fashion,use,If you don't fancy cutting up your jeans you could just use a rectangular piece of material to make a tube and fill in a similar fashion.
70,You,shaped  excluder,end,You'll end up with a more regular-shaped excluder.
71,perhaps Home Energy Scotland,knitted  version,have,"For the really crafty, or Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning divers perhaps, Home Energy Scotland have a pattern for a knitted version."
72,single place heat,single  glass,are,Badly fitting windows or single panes of glass are another place heat is often lost.
73,it,heavy  room,says,"If you can't get windows replaced with double glazing, the Energy Saving Trust says it is worth getting some heavy curtains to help keep the heat in the room."
74,that,you,show,"Again, the thermal images show how closing the curtains traps that heat in with you."
75,available DIY that,plastic  draughts,want,"You may not want to sit in the dark all day, so look out for cheap DIY kits available that use a thin plastic sheet to cover the window, blocking draughts."
76,They,shrink  hairdryer,are,They are sometimes shrink-fitted into place with a hairdryer and can be removed and replaced as required.
77,Insulating,below hat you,is like,Insulating your loft is like wearing a woolly hat - trapping the warmth below to keep you cosy.
78,However  hatch,other  attention,is,"However, that hatch is just like any other door and needs attention too."
79,thermal  heat,frame,surprised by,Even James was surprised by the thermal image showing heat being lost around the frame.
80,easy  it,snugly  edges,'s,"But it's an easy fix, making sure it is snugly insulated around the edges."
81,One  suggestion,then  it,is,"One suggestion online is to glue a plastic bag to the back of the hatch, fill it some of the loft insulation and then seal it up."
82,it,draughts escaping,help,"It should help insulate the hatch and flop over the edges when you pull it shut, stopping draughts escaping."
83,that,rather  anything,are,"There are lots of little things we can do around the home that will help save energy and money that just require tweaks to our behaviour rather than installing, fitting or making anything."
84,free  you,energy use,install,Most energy companies will install a smart meter for free so you can help monitor your energy use and spending.
85,daily  that,energy,are other,But there are other small changes to your daily routine that cost nothing and save energy.
86,obvious  ones,£  to£55,spending less,"The obvious ones are spending less time in the shower (potentially saving about £10 a year), turning off the lights (£14) or turning down the thermostat (saving up to£55)."
87,you,rooms,recommends,"The Eco-Experts blog recommends ""heating the humans, not the building"" - so perhaps don't keep the central heating on all the time if you're not cold, and don't heat rooms you're not in."
88,thick  layers,warm  them,put,"Other ideas include:And finally there is the old favourite - repeated by parents down the ages and still on the advice the elderly by Age UK - if you're cold, put on an extra layer - several thin layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thick layer, as the layers trap warm air between them."
89,how  you,quiz,check,"Finally ,check how much you know about saving energy with our quiz."
90,recent greenhouse gas emissions,2030,pledged at,Indonesia pledged at the recent COP26 climate summit that its greenhouse gas emissions would peak by 2030 and then start to fall.
91,also  it,same  date,said,It's also said that it will end deforestation by that same date.
92,transport it,forested biofuels land,relying on,"But to reduce emissions from its transport sector, it's relying on using more biofuels - production of which can lead to the loss of forested land."
93,how  it,regular diesel fuel,is,"So how can it both curb its emissions using biofuels and end deforestation by 2030?Indonesia is now the third largest producer of biofuels in the world, behind Brazil and the US, and the world's largest producer of biodiesel - a biofuel alternative to regular diesel fuel."
94,Biofuels,material power heating,come from,"Biofuels come from plant material and animal waste, and can be used to power vehicles or for heating and electricity."
95,traditional fossil they,fewer greenhouse gases,considered,"They are considered a renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels (coal, petrol and diesel) as they can be replenished quicker and release fewer greenhouse gases."
96,primarily diesel fuel,50 % 2025,produces,"Indonesia produces biodiesel from crops, primarily palm oil, and government policy stipulates that all diesel fuel must contain a mix of at least 30% biodiesel - to rise to 50% by 2025."
97,transport sector,45 energy consumption,accounts for,The transport sector accounts for 13.6% of the country's emissions and 45% of its energy consumption.
98,policy,36 million 36 2040,believes,The government believes this policy could reduce their transport emissions by 36 million tonnes of CO2 by 2040.
99,biofuel  production,three  demand,means,"But taken along with an expected 6% annual growth in its vehicle fleet, it means biofuel production will need to increase by nearly 50% over the next three years to meet demand."
100,This,a palm oil country,require,"This would require a substantial increase in land used for biofuel production, perhaps by as much as 1.2 million hectares - to about a quarter of all palm oil cultivation in the country."
101,which,net  emissions,reduce,"In theory, biofuels should reduce emissions compared with fossil fuels because when biofuel crops grow, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere which is then released through burning - meaning there is no net increase in emissions."
102,then  process,,replanted,The crops can then be replanted and the process started again.
103,such land which,crops,arise because,"However, problems arise because of land clearing such as deforestation, which is needed to grow these crops."
104,Forests,so  crops,are,"Forests are one of the most effective systems at absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, far more so than crops."
105,this,global greenhouse warming,means less,"Replacing them with biofuel crops means less CO2 is absorbed, and this leads to an increase of greenhouse gases - contributing to global warming."
106,soybean  it,more  diesel,cleared,So when forested land is cleared - as opposed to using existing agricultural land - to grow soybean or palm oil it can end up producing more emissions for each unit of energy than diesel.
107,government,sustainable  forests,tried,The government has tried to implement measures for the sustainable management of its forests.
108,year  it,new palm oil plantations,failed,"However, earlier this year it failed to extend a ban on new palm oil plantations."
109,promise,COP26,pledged,"Indonesia pledged to end deforestation by 2030 at COP26, but afterwards, its environment minister said the promise was ""clearly inappropriate and unfair""."
110,deforestation it,forests,defended,"In a BBC interview in October, Indonesian President Joko Widodo defended his country's deforestation record, and said it had ""rehabilitated a lot of hectares"" of forests."
111,annual  rate,deforestation,'s true,It's true the annual rate of deforestation has come down.
112,Indonesia,new palm oil plantations,continues,"But Indonesia continues to be one of the world's top three countries for the amount of forest loss, primarily because of new palm oil plantations."
113,presidential palm oil plantations,efficient  sunflower,told,"And when approached about this article, Febry Calvin Tetelepta from the presidential office told us palm oil plantations were a more efficient way to produce biofuel than using crops like sunflower and soy bean."
114,same  which,same  oil,said,He said palm oil requires relatively smaller amounts of land for the same quantity of oil - which is correct.
115,60 fuel attitudes,them,are more,"There are more than 60 countries with a requirement for biodiesel in their fuel supply, but attitudes are changing in some of them."
116,global  it,longer palm deforestation,says,"Germany, the fourth largest global producer of biofuels, says that from 2023 it will no longer produce biodiesel from palm oil because of concerns about deforestation."
117,EU,similarly  restrictions,tightened,The EU has similarly tightened its restrictions.
118,successive  which,soybean,reduced,"Brazil - another big user of biofuels - has reduced production this year because of successive droughts, which have lowered yields for soybean and corn."
119,production,diesel  mixes,suspended,Thailand has suspended indefinitely the rollout of diesel and biodiesel mixes because higher crop prices have made production unsustainable.
120,apart palm that,Indonesia,says,"Global Forest Watch says there are around 50 to 60 other, more environmentally friendly plants apart from palm oil, like candlenut and coconut, that could be used in Indonesia."
121,certification issues,sustainable deforestation alternatives,found,"However, research group Carbon Disclosure Project found that certification issues for biofuel production, alongside existing subsidies, encourages producers to continue with deforestation practices as opposed to seeking out sustainable alternatives."
122,it,electric transport emissions,says,Indonesia says it wants to move towards electric vehicles to cut transport emissions.
123,it,electric 2.2 2050,has,But it currently only has a modest plan for 2.2 million electric cars by 2030 and to sell only electric cars and motorcycles by 2050.
124,few 21 thousand,2020,has more,"Indonesia has more than 21 million vehicles on the road, but only a few thousand were electric by the end of 2020."
125,mostly  running,more  diesel,produces,"And given that 90% of Indonesia's electricity is produced from fossil fuels (mostly coal), running an electric vehicle currently produces significantly more emissions than using diesel or petrol."
126,growing Indonesia biofuels,major transportation sector,says given,"Filda Yusgiantoro, director of an Indonesia energy think tank, says given the growing demand for vehicles, ""biofuels.. from palm oil will still play a major role in supplying fuel needs for the transportation sector""."
