officially confirmed, sounding ""alarm bells"" over Earth's changing climate.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Tuesday verified the record, reported in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June last year.The temperature was 18C higher than the area's average daily maximum for June.The WMO, a UN agency, said the extreme heat was ""more befitting the Mediterranean than the Arctic"".It is the first time the agency has included the Arctic Circle in its archive of extreme weather reports.The WMO said the 38C temperature was measured at a meteorological station during ""an exceptional and prolonged Siberian heatwave"".Last year's extreme heat in the region contributed to the spread of wildfires, which swept across the forests and peatlands of northern Russia releasing record amounts of carbon.While relatively common in summer months, high temperatures and strong winds made the fires unusually severe.The high temperatures across Siberia led to ""massive sea ice loss"" and played a major role in 2020 being one of the three warmest years on record, the WMO said.The agency said its verification of the Verkhoyansk record highlighted how temperatures were increasing in a climatically important region of the world.""This new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.Mr Taalas told the BBC that melting snow and ice in the Russian Arctic were boosting warming.""This is very much caused by changes in the radiation properties of the soil and the ocean... once we had snow cover, the radiation properties of the surface is very different from the dark soil or open sea,"" he said.The WMO said it had added the Arctic Circle to its World Weather and Climate Extremes archive under a new category for high temperatures in the region.The Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions in the world, heating at more than twice the global average, the WMO said.Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.Human activity is contributing to a rise in world temperatures, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.",-0.2832159757614135,"{'MISC': ['Arctic', 'Siberian', 'Mediterranean', 'Arctic', 'Siberian', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic'],

on Twitter",2021-12-13,Thwaites: Antarctic glacier heading for dramatic change,"Scientists are warning of dramatic changes at one of the biggest glaciers in Antarctica, potentially within the next five to 10 years.They say a floating section at the front of Thwaites Glacier that until now has been relatively stable could ""shatter like a car windscreen"".US and UK researchers are currently engaged in an intense study programme at Thwaites because of its melt rate.Already it is dumping 50 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean each year.This is having limited impact on global sea-levels today, but there is sufficient ice held upstream in the glacier's drainage basin to raise the height of the oceans by 65cm - were it all to melt.Such a ""doomsday"" scenario is unlikely to come about for many centuries, but the study team says Thwaites is now responding to a warming world in really quite rapid ways.""There is going to be dramatic change in the front of the glacier, probably in less than a decade. Both published and unpublished studies point in that direction,"" said glaciologist Prof Ted Scambos, US lead coordinator for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC).""This will accelerate the pace (of Thwaites) and widen, effectively, the dangerous part of the glacier,"" he told BBC News.Thwaites is a colossus. It's roughly the size of Great Britain, or Florida, and its outflow speed has doubled in the past 30 years.The ITGC has established how this is happening. It is the result of warm ocean water getting under - and melting - Thwaites's floating front, or ice shelf as it's known.The warm water is thinning and weakening this ice, making it run faster and pushing back the zone where the main glacier body becomes buoyant.At the moment, the leading edge of the eastern ice shelf is pinned in place by an offshore underwater ridge, which means its flow speed is a third of that seen in the ice shelf's western sector which has no such constraint.But the ITGC team says the eastern shelf is likely to become uncoupled from the ridge in the next few years which will destabilise it. And even if the pinning persists, the ongoing development of fractures in the shelf ice will almost certainly break up the area anyway.""I visualise it somewhat similar to that car window where you have a few cracks that are slowly propagating, and then suddenly you go over a bump in your car and the whole thing just starts to shatter in every direction,"" explained Dr Erin Pettit from Oregon State University.The affected area is very small when considered in the context of the glacier as a whole, but it is the shift to a new regime and what this means for further ice loss that is the real significance.At present, the eastern shelf, which has a width of about 40km, moves forward at about 600m per year. The coming change in status will probably see the following ice jump in speed to about 2km per year - the same as the current velocity recorded in the 80km-wide western sector.Jointly funded by the US National Science Foundation and the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, the five-year ITGC project is putting Thwaites under unprecedented scrutiny.Each Antarctic summer season, teams of scientists are investigating the glacier's behaviour in every way possible. From satellite, on the ice, and from ships in front of Thwaites.Those teams are en route for the new season right now, some in Covid quarantine ahead of their deployment to the field.One of the projects for the New Year will see the tubby yellow submarine known as ""Boaty McBoatface"" dive under Thwaites' floating ice to gather data on water temperature, current direction and turbulence - all factors that influence melting.The autonomous vehicle will go on missions lasting one to four days, navigating its own path through the cavity beneath the shelf. This is high risk as the seafloor terrain is extremely rugged.""It's scary. We might not get Boaty back,"" conceded Dr Alex Phillips from the UK's National Oceanography Centre.""We've put a lot of effort this past year into developing collision avoidance for the vehicle, to make sure it doesn't crash into the seabed. We also have contingencies whereby if it does get into trouble, it can retrace its steps and retreat to safety.""The latest science on Thwaites Glacier is being presented this week at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans.",-0.0048782339802494,"{'LOC': ['Antarctica', 'Thwaites Glacier', 'US', 'UK', 'US', 'Great Britain', 'Florida', 'UK', ""Thwaites'"", 'UK', 'New Orleans'], 'PER': ['Thwaites', 'Ted Scambos', 'Thwaites', 'Thwaites', 'Erin Pettit', 'Thwaites', 'Boaty', 'Alex Phillips'], 'ORG': ['ITGC', 'BBC News', 'ITGC', 'ITGC', 'Oregon State University', 'US National Science Foundation', 'Natural Environment Research Council', 'American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting'], 'MISC': ['Antarctic']}","['', 'Thwaites Glacier', 'Map', 'Boaty McBoatface', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/64/cpsprodpb/3E76/production/_112909951_jonathanamos.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17D48/production/_122080679_0c9b33ea-9bd1-477d-8c68-aa0d8b031ab7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6BD8/production/_122080672_thwaites-v2-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11C39/production/_122216727_boaty3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_1_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_1_image_18.jpg']"
2,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58913875,,2021-12-10,Climate change: Four cheap ways to save energy at home,"Making your home more energy efficient can be costly and may not be possible if you're renting, or you don't have thousands of pounds stashed away to buy new heat pumps and double glazing.But there are some cheap solutions to try to save money. We've looked at where you are likely to be losing the most energy in your home and come up with some simple solutions to help save money on your bills and keep warm this winter.Warm air wants to leave your home and will find any nook and cranny to do so. As it does, cold air is sucked in to replace it, causing draughts. It makes your home cold and wastes energy.Shutting doors and closing windows may not be enough as any gaps in the frames allow warm air to escape - and that costs money. On this thermal image, the draughts show up as the coldest areas around a front door.The coolest temperatures are black, purple and blue and the draughts are shown around the door in these colours, says James Richardson, of IRT Surveys - which uses thermal imaging to help home owners identify where heat is being lost.The letter box, often an escape route for hot air, appears warm (red and yellow colours) so it is likely to be well-sealed and insulated.But by simply adding a draught excluder - or even a rolled up towel - the draughts can be blocked, as we can see in these before and after images:Energy firms and energy-saving campaigners agree one of the simplest solutions to keeping out the cold is to use a draught excluder. Combined with draught-proofing of windows and doors, it could help cut around £25 a year off your bills.Having a rolled-up towel by the front door may not be the most attractive household feature, but you can always try to make and decorate one yourself.It is important to make sure the draught excluder covers the width of the door. And for a no-sew method, use strips of the discarded material to make ties and tie up each end of the trouser leg instead.If you don't fancy cutting up your jeans you could just use a rectangular piece of material to make a tube and fill in a similar fashion. You'll end up with a more regular-shaped excluder.For the really crafty, or Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning divers perhaps, Home Energy Scotland have a pattern for a knitted version.Badly fitting windows or single panes of glass are another place heat is often lost.If you can't get windows replaced with double glazing, the Energy Saving Trust says it is worth getting some heavy curtains to help keep the heat in the room.Again, the thermal images show how closing the curtains traps that heat in with you.You may not want to sit in the dark all day, so look out for cheap DIY kits available that use a thin plastic sheet to cover the window, blocking draughts.They are sometimes shrink-fitted into place with a hairdryer and can be removed and replaced as required.Insulating your loft is like wearing a woolly hat - trapping the warmth below to keep you cosy. However, that hatch is just like any other door and needs attention too.Even James was surprised by the thermal image showing heat being lost around the frame. But it's an easy fix, making sure it is snugly insulated around the edges.One suggestion online is to glue a plastic bag to the back of the hatch, fill it some of the loft insulation and then seal it up. It should help insulate the hatch and flop over the edges when you pull it shut, stopping draughts escaping.There are lots of little things we can do around the home that will help save energy and money that just require tweaks to our behaviour rather than installing, fitting or making anything.Most energy companies will install a smart meter for free so you can help monitor your energy use and spending.But there are other small changes to your daily routine that cost nothing and save energy. The obvious ones are spending less time in the shower (potentially saving about £10 a year), turning off the lights (£14) or turning down the thermostat (saving up to£55).The Eco-Experts blog recommends ""heating the humans, not the building"" - so perhaps don't keep the central heating on all the time if you're not cold, and don't heat rooms you're not in.Other ideas include:And finally there is the old favourite - repeated by parents down the ages and still on the advice the elderly by Age UK - if you're cold, put on an extra layer - several thin layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thick layer, as the layers trap warm air between them.Finally ,check how much you know about saving energy with our quiz.",-0.0348236908515294,"{'PER': ['James Richardson', 'James'], 'MISC': ['Olympic'], 'ORG': ['Energy Saving Trust']}","['Girl looks out of window on cold day', 'Thermal images show draught excluder helps room heat up', 'Step-by-step guide to making a draught excluder from a pair of jeans', 'Presentational white space', 'Short presentational grey line', 'Condensation on windows', 'Thermal images show cold areas around a window and the difference it makes when you close the curtains', 'Presentational white space', 'Short presentational grey line', 'Man laying insulation in loft', 'Thermal camera shows heat lost through loft hatch', 'Short presentational grey line', 'Pot on stove', 'Short presentational grey line', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7068/production/_121167782_gettyimages-556417487_window.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A030/production/_121080014_doordraught_excluder5reg2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/15F98/production/_121080009_drought_excluder6402x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/03F0/production/_121080010_whitespace2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BE88/production/_121167784_gettyimages-1186727911windows976.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4958/production/_121167781_thermal_curtains22x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/03F0/production/_121080010_whitespace2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E598/production/_121167785_gettyimages-523409780_loft976.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/10CA8/production/_121167786_thermal_loft_hatch_heatlossv2_640x2-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/133B8/production/_121167787_gettyimages-1250319544pot.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_2_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_18.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_19.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_20.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_21.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_22.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_23.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_24.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_25.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_26.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_27.jpg', 'Images/link_2_image_28.jpg']"

Reality Check",2021-12-08,Indonesia's biodiesel drive is leading to deforestation,"Indonesia pledged at the recent COP26 climate summit that its greenhouse gas emissions would peak by 2030 and then start to fall.It's also said that it will end deforestation by that same date.But to reduce emissions from its transport sector, it's relying on using more biofuels - production of which can lead to the loss of forested land.So how can it both curb its emissions using biofuels and end deforestation by 2030?Indonesia is now the third largest producer of biofuels in the world, behind Brazil and the US, and the world's largest producer of biodiesel - a biofuel alternative to regular diesel fuel.Biofuels come from plant material and animal waste, and can be used to power vehicles or for heating and electricity.They are considered a renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels (coal, petrol and diesel) as they can be replenished quicker and release fewer greenhouse gases.Indonesia produces biodiesel from crops, primarily palm oil, and government policy stipulates that all diesel fuel must contain a mix of at least 30% biodiesel - to rise to 50% by 2025.The transport sector accounts for 13.6% of the country's emissions and 45% of its energy consumption. The government believes this policy could reduce their transport emissions by 36 million tonnes of CO2 by 2040.But taken along with an expected 6% annual growth in its vehicle fleet, it means biofuel production will need to increase by nearly 50% over the next three years to meet demand.This would require a substantial increase in land used for biofuel production, perhaps by as much as 1.2 million hectares - to about a quarter of all palm oil cultivation in the country.In theory, biofuels should reduce emissions compared with fossil fuels because when biofuel crops grow, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere which is then released through burning - meaning there is no net increase in emissions.The crops can then be replanted and the process started again.However, problems arise because of land clearing such as deforestation, which is needed to grow these crops.Forests are one of the most effective systems at absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, far more so than crops.Replacing them with biofuel crops means less CO2 is absorbed, and this leads to an increase of greenhouse gases - contributing to global warming.So when forested land is cleared - as opposed to using existing agricultural land - to grow soybean or palm oil it can end up producing more emissions for each unit of energy than diesel.The government has tried to implement measures for the sustainable management of its forests. However, earlier this year it failed to extend a ban on new palm oil plantations.Indonesia pledged to end deforestation by 2030 at COP26, but afterwards, its environment minister said the promise was ""clearly inappropriate and unfair"".In a BBC interview in October, Indonesian President Joko Widodo defended his country's deforestation record, and said it had ""rehabilitated a lot of hectares"" of forests.It's true the annual rate of deforestation has come down. But Indonesia continues to be one of the world's top three countries for the amount of forest loss, primarily because of new palm oil plantations.And when approached about this article, Febry Calvin Tetelepta from the presidential office told us palm oil plantations were a more efficient way to produce biofuel than using crops like sunflower and soy bean.He said palm oil requires relatively smaller amounts of land for the same quantity of oil - which is correct.There are more than 60 countries with a requirement for biodiesel in their fuel supply, but attitudes are changing in some of them.Germany, the fourth largest global producer of biofuels, says that from 2023 it will no longer produce biodiesel from palm oil because of concerns about deforestation.The EU has similarly tightened its restrictions.Brazil - another big user of biofuels - has reduced production this year because of successive droughts, which have lowered yields for soybean and corn.Thailand has suspended indefinitely the rollout of diesel and biodiesel mixes because higher crop prices have made production unsustainable.Global Forest Watch says there are around 50 to 60 other, more environmentally friendly plants apart from palm oil, like candlenut and coconut, that could be used in Indonesia.However, research group Carbon Disclosure Project found that certification issues for biofuel production, alongside existing subsidies, encourages producers to continue with deforestation practices as opposed to seeking out sustainable alternatives.Indonesia says it wants to move towards electric vehicles to cut transport emissions.But it currently only has a modest plan for 2.2 million electric cars by 2030 and to sell only electric cars and motorcycles by 2050.Indonesia has more than 21 million vehicles on the road, but only a few thousand were electric by the end of 2020.And given that 90% of Indonesia's electricity is produced from fossil fuels (mostly coal), running an electric vehicle currently produces significantly more emissions than using diesel or petrol.Filda Yusgiantoro, director of an Indonesia energy think tank, says given the growing demand for vehicles, ""biofuels.. from palm oil will still play a major role in supplying fuel needs for the transportation sector"".Additional research by Astudestra Ajengrastri and Nurika Manan from BBC

BBC News, Tokyo",2021-12-06,Climate change: Is ‘blue hydrogen’ Japan’s answer to coal?,"It's a glorious autumn afternoon and I'm standing on a hillside looking out over Tokyo Bay. Beside me is Takao Saiki, a usually mild-mannered gentleman in his 70s.But today Saiki-San is angry.""It's a total joke,"" he says, in perfect English. ""Just ridiculous!""The cause of his distress is a giant construction site blocking our view across the bay - a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power station in the making.""I don't understand why we still have to burn coal to generate electricity,"" says Saiki-San's friend, Rikuro Suzuki. ""This plant alone will emit more than seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year!""Suzuki-San's point is a good one. Shouldn't Japan be cutting its coal consumption, not increasing it, at a time of great concern about coal's impact on the climate?So why the coal? The answer is the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.In 2010 about one third of Japan's electricity came from nuclear power, and there were plans to build a lot more. But then the 2011 disaster hit, and all Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down. Ten years later most remain closed - and there is a lot of resistance to restarting them.In their place Japan's gas-fired power stations have been doing a lot of overtime. But, as Britain has found out recently, natural gas is expensive.So, the Japanese government decided to build 22 new coal-fired power stations, to run on cheap coal imported from Australia. Economically it made sense. Environmentally, not so much. Japan is now under intense pressure to stop using coal.Instead of closing the old coal plants and switching to renewables, Japan's answer is to switch to burning hydrogen or ammonia.""The investment made by electric power companies in coal-fired power plants would suddenly be useless without value in their balance sheet,"" says Prof Tomas Kaberger, an expert on energy policy at Chalmers University in Sweden.""And it would create financial difficulties for electric power companies and then for banks and pension funds. And that is the challenge for Japan.""The plants can be quite easily converted to burning hydrogen or ammonia, neither of which produce any carbon dioxide. So this seems like a good solution.But Japan's government has much bigger ambitions than that. It wants to be the world's first ""hydrogen economy"".This is where the carmaker Toyota comes in.It's another lovely sunny day and I'm in downtown Tokyo, at a shiny new hydrogen filling station. Standing on the forecourt is a sleek new Toyota Mirai. This is a big luxury car, about the size of a large Lexus.I slip into the leather-clad cabin, press the ""start"" button and glide out on to the street. The car is extremely smooth, completely silent, and the only thing dribbling on to the road behind me is a bit of water.The Mirai (which means future in Japanese) is Toyota's first zero-emissions electric car. Unlike other electric cars, the Mirai doesn't have a huge battery under the floor. Instead, it has a fuel cell under the bonnet, and hydrogen tanks under the back seat. Hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a fuel cell to form water, with the reaction releasing energy as electricity, which runs the electric motors. It's the same technology that was used to power the Apollo spacecraft on the Moon missions.To many people this technology is an odd choice. It's more expensive and complicated than batteries. Elon Musk has called hydrogen cars ""stupid"".Not true, says Hisashi Nakai, the head of Toyota's public affairs division. He says the company's vision for fuel cells goes much further than just cars.""I know people have different opinions,"" he tells me, ""but the important thing is realising carbon neutrality. We need to think about how we can make the most out of fuel cell technology. We strongly believe in hydrogen as a powerful and important energy.""What Nakai-san says shows Toyota is thinking of a future where hydrogen fuel cells are everywhere, in homes and offices and factories, as well as cars. And it wants to be at the forefront of this new hydrogen society.This brings us to the final, and most important question. Where is the hydrogen to power Japan zero carbon society going to come from?The answer is ""blue hydrogen"".Make hydrogen from water using renewable energy and you get ""green hydrogen"". The problem is green hydrogen is really expensive.Instead, today most hydrogen is made from natural gas, or even coal. That is cheap but it produces lots of greenhouse gases. However, if you capture those greenhouse gases and bury them in the ground, you are allowed to call it ""blue hydrogen"".This is exactly what Japan says it is going to do.Earlier this year, Japan and Australia opened a joint project in the state of Victoria to turn a type of coal called lignite, or brown coal, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then liquified to minus 253C, then piped into a specially built ship which carries it to Japan.What happens to the greenhouse gases produced at the site? Right now, they go straight up into the atmosphere. But Japan and Australia are promising that, at some point in the future, they will begin capturing the greenhouse gas produced at the Latrobe Valley site and inject it into the sea floor off the coast.Climate change campaigners are horrified by this plan. They say the technology to capture and store greenhouse gases is unproven and it will lock Japan into digging up vast quantities of brown coal for decades to come.According to Prof Kaberger, the biggest hole in the plan is economic.""Technically it's possible, but it will always be expensive,"" he says. ""Using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage will always be more expensive than using fossil fuels alone, and now in many parts of the world renewable electricity is already cheaper than fossil fuels without carbon capture.""Prof Kaberger thinks the Japanese government chose blue hydrogen a decade ago when renewables were expensive, and they are now locked into a plan that no longer makes sense.""Japanese companies need cheap electricity to be competitive and they need clean electricity to be internationally acceptable,"" he says. ""That means they need renewable electricity. Delaying this development will harm the Japanese economy.""In the meantime, on the edge of Tokyo Bay, construction continues apace. The giant new coal-fired power station will go online in 2023. It is expected to run for at least 40 years.""I am ashamed of Japan,"" says Hikari Matsumoto, a 21-year-old activist who has joined us to look out from the hillside.""I'm so frustrated,"" she says. ""In other countries young people are out on the street protesting, but Japanese people are so quiet. Our generation needs to voice its opinion.""",-0.1910891901879083,"{'LOC': ['Tokyo Bay', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Sweden.', 'Japan.', 'Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Victoria', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'Australia', 'Latrobe Valley', 'Japan', 'Japan'], 'PER': ['Takao Saiki', 'Saiki-San', 'Saiki-San', 'Rikuro Suzuki', 'Suzuki-San', 'Tomas Kaberger', 'Hisashi Nakai', 'Kaberger', 'Kaberger', 'Hikari Matsumoto'], 'MISC': ['English', 'Japanese', 'Toyota Mirai', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'Japanese'], 'ORG': ['Chalmers University', 'Toyota', 'Lexus', 'Toyota', 'Elon Musk', 'Toyota', 'Toyota']}","['Activist looking at the plant', 'Takao Saiki and Rikuro Suzuki', ""The Mirai (which means future in Japanese) is Toyota's first zero emissions electric car."", 'Coal piles are seen at JERA""s Hekinan thermal power station in Hekinan, central Japan October 18, 202', 'A new coal-fired power plant being built in Japan', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/246E/production/_121962390_activistlookingattheplant.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18016/production/_121962389_takaosaikiandrikurosuzuki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1D02/production/_121962470_toyotamirai.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1037A/production/_121962466_mediaitem121962465.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8E4A/production/_121962463_newcoalfiredpowerplantbeingbuild.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_4_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_18.jpg', 'Images/link_4_image_19.jpg']"
5,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-59517776,,2021-12-03,Cambo: Jobs warning as Shell pulls out of oil field development,"Business leaders have warned that thousands of oil and gas jobs could be at risk in the UK after Shell pulled out of the Cambo oil field development.Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce said a ""premature"" end to domestic production could see some areas suffer the fate of mining communities in the 1980s.Environmentalists say new fossil fuel projects like Cambo are incompatible with action on climate change.Cambo's majority stakeholder said it still planned to take it forward.Siccar Point Energy is currently awaiting approval from the UK government to develop the field.Chief executive Jonathan Roger said other countries including Norway were investing in new oil and gas alongside renewables as part of a transition to sustainable energy.He added: ""The UK is at risk of damaging its economy and increasing imports with a higher carbon impact if new developments are not brought forward during this time.""Shell, which has faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo, said it now believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"".Greenpeace welcomed the announcement, describing it as the ""death blow"" for the plans.But industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo were still needed.External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners but doesn't change the facts that the UK will continue to need new oil and gas projects if we are to protect security of supply, avoid increasing reliance on imports and support jobs.""It is too early to write the obituary of the North Sea oil and gas industry, despite claims by some environmental campaigners that Shell's decision marks the beginning of the end.That's because, whatever Shell says in public, this is about reputational cost not conventional economics.Battling environmentalists and the Scottish government for the right to drill for oil is not a good look for a company that claims to be transitioning away from fossil fuels.But the Cambo oilfield is reckoned to hold hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, each worth some $70 at current prices, and there are lots of less high-profile companies who would be willing to suffer some bad publicity for a cut of that prize.So, the real question Shell's decision raises is whether the UK government is willing to put its net-zero ambitions ahead of the huge tax revenues the project could deliver and deny a licence to develop the oilfield.The chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce called for a ""reasoned debate"" about oil and gas extraction, which he said supported thousands of UK jobs.Russell Borthwick said there was enormous potential for the renewable energy sector in the region but he warned against a ""knee jerk"" reaction to climate change.He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""If we get this wrong, all of those people and organisations demanding a premature end to domestic oil and gas production might want to be able to reflect back to their role in scripting a repeat of what happened to our mining communities in the 1980s.""The fallout from the 1984/85 miners strike and the long term decline of UK coal mining left many communities facing high unemployment and other problems that were still being felt decades later.Businessman Sir Ian Wood chairs Aberdeen's Energy Transition Zone, a not-for-profit company set up to support the shift to renewable energy. He said: ""We must not create an adverse investment environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey.""The future prosperity of our region and the country's ability to meet net zero, depends on it.""Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie welcomed Shell's announcement and said it made it less likely Cambo would go ahead in the ""near term"".""It's absurd to suggest that our transition to a zero carbon economy depends on drilling for ever more oil and gas,"" he said.He said Scotland had a quarter of Europe's wind energy potential, and that investment should be focused on renewables instead.""We could be exporting renewable resources and make that the backbone of Scotland's economy,"" he told the BBC.He continued: ""The idea of keeping global warming below 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees if we possibly can - this is not optional.""This is not a normal political choice. This is mission critical for our survival.""It is humanity's only survival strategy and we need to invest now in the transition that has to be fair, but it has to be fast.""Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the Highlands on Friday for an announcement on plans for a major offshore wind turbine tower factory.She said Shell had made ""a commercial decision"" and that it was ""for others to determine what that means in terms of the economic viability"" of Cambo.""I have made my views clear that it shouldn't be given the green light, it should be subjected to a very rigorous climate assessment.""But it does illustrate the importance of accelerating that transition from fossil fuels to low carbon alternatives.""Nobody is saying that we can shut oil and gas off overnight. We cannot do that and nobody is saying, least of all me, that we leave those currently working in oil and gas on the scrap heap.""The UK government, which makes the final decision on whether to allow drilling, insists an environmental impact assessment will be carried out but appears far more supportive.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has said the new field should ""100%"" get the go-ahead.On Friday, Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK government ""continues to have a very strong commitment to the oil and gas sector and to the North Sea transition deal that we did a year ago.""For some years to come we will be very dependent as a country on gas in particular, and we need to make sure that the gas continues to come from the UK continental shelf to the UK.""He also said that the government had a ""very strong"" net zero commitment.",-0.4098685246247511,"{'LOC': ['UK', 'Cambo', 'Cambo', 'UK', 'Norway', 'UK', 'UK', 'North Sea', 'Cambo', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'Scotland', 'Europe', 'Scotland', 'Scotland', 'Highlands', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK.'], 'ORG': ['Shell', 'Chamber of Commerce', 'Cambo', 'Siccar Point Energy', 'Shell', 'Cambo', 'Greenpeace', 'Oil and Gas UK', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'Shell', 'Grampian Chamber of Commerce', ""Aberdeen's Energy Transition Zone"", 'Shell', 'Cambo', 'BBC', 'Shell', 'Cambo.'], 'PER': ['Jonathan Roger', 'Jenny Stanning', 'Russell Borthwick', 'Ian Wood', 'Patrick Harvie', 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'Alister Jack', 'Greg Hands'], 'MISC': ['Scottish', 'Scottish']}","['Getty Images', 'Presentational grey line', 'Analysis box by Justin Rowlatt, chief environment correspondent', 'Presentational grey line', 'Presentational grey line', 'Map', 'Presentational grey line', 'Cambo protest', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3B33/production/_121955151_gettyimages-1148474010.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/125F4/production/_114725257_justinrowlatt_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/EA1F/production/_119953995_west_shetland_cambo_oilfield2_x2640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FE83/production/_121955156_camboprotestgetty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_5_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_18.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_19.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_20.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_21.jpg', 'Images/link_5_image_22.jpg']"

BBC environment analyst",2021-12-02,COP26: UK 'nowhere near' meeting targets agreed at Glasgow climate summit,"The UK is ""nowhere near"" meeting emissions targets enshrined at the Glasgow climate summit, official advisers have warned.The Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that, at current rates, the UK will be contributing to a disastrous temperature rise of 2.7C by 2100.It says this could - in theory - be brought down to just under 2C.But this could only happen if ministers agree tougher policies, and if other nations slash emissions too.The government insists that it will meet all its climate change targets.Scientists say any temperature rise approaching 2C is extremely dangerous, so green groups want the UK to improve its emissions targets.But the CCC says Britain will set a better example to the world if it keeps the same targets but actually delivers them through stronger policies.It maintains that the government must nudge people towards greener lifestyles, and must tackle emissions from farming more aggressively.The committee's chief executive, Chris Stark, said: ""The government is nowhere near achieving current targets.""If it sets tougher targets that will simply widen the gap between ambition and delivery. What we really need is to strengthen delivery - and show the world that it can be done.""His group has produced a shortlist of ideas to support Britain's climate leadership.They include producing convincing plans to cut emissions by 78% by 2035; and drawing up agreements to radically reduce so-called ""embodied emissions"" from major polluters such as steel and cement.The CCC also says the UK should act to reduce embodied emissions in imported goods - the emissions created to make the stuff British residents buy.This could happen through taxes imposed on carbon-intensive goods being imported into the UK.Another proposed strategy could be based on the final agreement at COP to phase out inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.The committee says this gives the government licence to change tax policy so that fossil fuels pay for the damage they cause to the climate. It says the current tax system is currently clearly inefficient because it fails to bear down on polluting sectors that are damaging the climate.This proposal could lead to increases in the cost of petrol, gas and aviation.The government has been reviewing tax options, but it's been reported that senior ministers have warned against policies that could increase the cost of living for some.UK climate experts are worried about the Treasury's role in emissions policy. The Chancellor was widely blamed for failing to support the ill-fated Green Homes Grant. And, in his Budget just days before the COP, he omitted to mention climate change.""The government is moving far too slowly,"" said Greenpeace director John Sauven.""For the committee (CCC) to suggest it's OK for the UK to contribute to a temperature rise approaching 2C is outrageous. We know that a rise of 1.5C isn't safe - we're not even all safe now with a rise of 1.1C.""What are we going to tell future generations about how we wrecked the climate?""A government response to the CCC has been sought.Follow Roger on Twitter.",-0.6657374578973522,"{'LOC': ['UK', 'Glasgow', 'UK', 'UK', 'Britain', 'Britain', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK'], 'ORG': ['Climate Change Committee', 'CCC', 'CCC', 'CCC', 'COP', 'Treasury', 'Greenpeace', 'CCC', 'CCC'], 'PER': ['Chris Stark', 'John Sauven.', 'Roger'], 'MISC': ['British']}","['Wind farm near mouth of the river Tees', 'Chart', 'Boris Johnson', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/38CD/production/_121914541_071569036.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/16F79/production/_121537049_cop26_emissions_target_640x2-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/130B2/production/_121320087_johnsongetty2nov2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_6_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_6_image_17.jpg']"
7,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56901261,,2021-11-15,COP26: What was agreed at the Glasgow climate conference?,"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:EmissionsIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C.CoalFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India.Developing countriesThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed.While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made.Fossil fuel subsidiesWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.However, no firm dates have been set.A flurry of other announcements were made:The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action.Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.This is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2.Similar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.A scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries.Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming.The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.Financial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise.Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding.COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement.Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030.The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.Top image from Getty Images.

BBC News",2021-11-09,Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?,"As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase.The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life.And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then.""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London.More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward.""The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind.Last week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough.""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'.""""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.""One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit.However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed.An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions.By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world.""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.""There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes.Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example.Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development.""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.""The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023.The US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather.For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events.""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.""There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together.""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""",-0.1353942709309714,"{'MISC': ['COP26', 'Covid-19'], 'LOC': ['Glasgow', 'Paris', 'China', 'Saudi Arabia', 'India', 'Glasgow', 'UK', 'US', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladesh', 'Germany', 'Accra'], 'PER': ['Mark Maslin', 'Martin Siegert', 'Siegert', 'Malte Meinhausen', 'Natalie Jones', 'Danae Kyriakopoulou', 'Aditya Bahadur', 'Bahadur', 'Nana Ama Browne Klutse'], 'ORG': ['Imperial College London', 'COP', 'University of Melbourne', 'University of Cambridge', 'London School of Economics', 'World Trade Organization', 'International Institute for Environment and Development.', 'UN']}","['Girl holding a sign saying ""If not you, who?

9,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59036722,,2021-11-06,COP26: How the world is reacting to the climate summit,"It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.More than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.The US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.BBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.Chinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.The response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.Perhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.Also, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.Of course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.But Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.Perhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.It's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New YorkPresident Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.Since President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that ""put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day.The US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.The conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as ""isolated holdouts"" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.At home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.Mr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: ""Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.""There is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.Go compare.A British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.Russia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?It concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are ""positive consequences of global warming"" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.There's no sense here of a climate emergency.Not that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average.It sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only.Still, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.But it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a ""smooth"" (longer) transition to greener energy.""Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,"" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me.""I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet.""India's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.Although India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.But on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note.Mr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs.They were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, ""India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions"" - a line that many here applauded.The First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a ""bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West"". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.Australia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.Part of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.On Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept ""sledging"" or ""slurs"".And so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.""Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,"" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. ""And it was never more on show than this week as he sold ""the Australian Way"" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.""Australia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.The verdict from Australia's ABC News? A ""terribly messy week"" for the prime minister.The climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in São Paulo.Much is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here.Yes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like São Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland.It's not that Brazilians don't care.""People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,"" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.But since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. ""What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,"" Ms Cervellini says.And that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.""If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,"" she says. ""We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.""Many in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.Iran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.US sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.One member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, ""there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions"".However, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.Although the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.A few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26.Public opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence.COP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.The big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria.On Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed ""persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,"" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as ""enough evidence"".But he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.The president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.No-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.Climate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.Even as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.For a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions.Then last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060.But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.The country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by ""demonising"" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.Most officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted.",-0.2646338453759317,"{'MISC': ['COP26', 'Chinese', 'COP26', 'Chinese', 'Chinese', 'COP26', 'American', 'Americans', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'British', 'Russian', 'COP', 'Cop26', 'French', 'Australian Way', 'Brazilians', 'Brazilians', 'Brazilian', 'COP26', 'Iranian', 'COP26', 'COP26', 'Western', 'Saudis'], 'LOC': ['Glasgow', 'US', 'Shanghai', 'Sao Paulo', 'Beijing', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'China', 'US', 'US', 'Paris', 'US', 'Glasgow', 'Russia', 'China', 'US', 'Moscow', 'Beijing', 'West Virginia', 'Russia', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Kremlin', 'Russia', 'Glasgow', 'Russia', 'Glasgow', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'India', 'Delhi', 'India', 'India', 'Glasgow', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'Australia', 'Sydney', 'Glasgow', 'Glasgow', 'France', 'Australia', 'Glasgow', 'Australia', 'Glasgow', 'China', 'Russia', 'India', 'Iran', 'Australia', 'Scotland', 'São Paulo', 'Brazil', 'Amazon', 'São Paulo', 'Rio', 'Scotland', 'Brazil', 'Minas Gerais', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'US', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Iran', 'Nigeria', 'Abuja', 'Nigeria', 'Africa', 'Glasgow', 'Nigeria', 'Nigeria', 'Nigeria', 'Glasgow', 'China', 'Niger Delta', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Saudi Arabia'], 'ORG': ['EU', 'Communist Party', 'Communist Party', 'Party', 'MSNBC', 'Wall St Journal', 'Congress', 'Greenpeace Russia', 'First Post', 'Cop26', 'Guardian', 'ABC News', 'Delibera', 'BBC Persian Service', 'COP26', 'UN'], 'PER': ['Stephen McDonell', 'Xi Jinping', 'Xi', 'Xi', 'Joe Biden', 'Laura Trevelyan', 'Biden', 'Hayes Brown', 'Trump', 'Biden', 'Joe Manchin', 'Manchin', 'Biden', 'Steve Rosenberg', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Vasily Yablokov', 'Narendra Modi', 'Rajini Vaidyanathan', 'Modi', 'Modi', 'Modi', 'Shaimaa Khalil', 'Scott Morrison', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Macron', 'Morrison', 'Morrison', 'Morrison', 'Scott Morrison', 'Hugh Riminton', 'Katy Watson', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'Silvia Cervellini', 'Cervellini', 'Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho', 'Siavash Ardalan', 'Ebrahim Raisi', 'Nduka Orjinmo', 'Muhammadu Buhari', 'Sameer Hashmi', 'Mohammed bin Salman']}","['A firefighter douses flames as they push towards homes during the Creek fire in the Cascadel Woods area of unincorporated Madera County, California on 7 September 2020', 'China', 'US', 'A tractor moves through a coal prep plant outside the city of Welch in rural West Virginia on May 19, 2017', 'Russia', 'India', '1px transparent line', 'Australia', 'Brazil', 'Officials from Para State, northern Brazil, inspect a deforested area in the Amazon rain forest during surveillance in the municipality of Pacaja, 620 km from the capital Belem, on September 22, 2021', 'Iran', 'Nigeria', '1px transparent line', 'Strapline -

BBC News",2021-11-19,Deforestation: Which countries are still cutting down trees?,"World leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.But in Brazil's Amazon rainforest it has hit its highest level in over 15 years - and progress elsewhere is challenging.Some 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, and it plays a vital role in absorbing harmful CO2 that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.After falling steadily since 2004, deforestation in Brazil's Amazon has risen again, according to the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE).Its latest report found that deforestation increased by 22% in the last year, with 13,235 sq km (5,110 sq miles) of forest lost.Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been criticised for ""anti-environment"" policies, such as encouraging agriculture and mining in the Amazon.He has cut the funding for the government agencies that are responsible for prosecuting farmers and loggers who break environmental law. Fines for illegal logging fell by 20% in 2020.Exact figures are not available, but recent studies suggest as much as 94% of deforestation and habitat destruction in Brazil could be illegal.Brazil is not the only country responsible for the deforestation of the Amazon - neighbouring countries, including Bolivia, also contribute.Last year, Bolivia lost almost 300,000 hectares of tropical forest - the fourth-highest in the world.The Congo forest basin is the second-largest rainforest in the world. More than half of it lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo.Environmental campaign group Greenpeace says illegal logging - by both large and small companies - is leading to deforestation. Although the US and EU have banned importing illegal timber, it still gets smuggled outside the country.Other threats include small-scale subsistence agriculture, clearing for charcoal and fuel, urban expansion and mining.In the past five years, the annual loss of primary forest has been nearly half a million hectares, according to Global Forest Watch.President Felix Tshisekedi last month ordered an audit of some of the leases allocated to harvest public forests - including one for more than 1.4 million hectares - amid allegations of corruption. The move was welcomed by campaigners.But earlier this year, the government also announced a plan to lift a ban dating back to 2002 on new logging operations - although it has not yet been implemented.Greenpeace says that would contradict commitments made earlier this year to protect the forest and increase forest cover by 8%.Indonesia has been among the world's top five countries for forest loss for the past two decades.According to data from Global Forest Watch, the country lost 9.75 million hectares of primary forest between 2002 and 2020.President Joko Widodo pledged in 2014 to crack down on deforestation by tackling the main contributor - clearing land for oil palm plantations.Up to 80% of fires were set for this purpose, according to official data.In 2016, a record 929,000 hectares of forest disappeared, but there's been a steady decrease in the rate of deforestation since then.By 2020, the annual loss was down to 270,000 hectares.In 2019, President Widodo issued a three-year moratorium on new forest clearance, covering about 66 million hectares of primary forest and peatland. This was extended indefinitely this year.Forests absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a major contributor to global warming - so cutting down trees can have a big impact on climate change.The UN says 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost since 1990. Agriculture is the main reason for this.More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, at the COP26 summit.There have been efforts to protect forests before.In 2014 the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030.Then, in 2017, it set another target to increase forested land by 3% worldwide by 2030.But deforestation continued at ""an alarming rate"", according to a 2019 report, with serious consequences for the fight against climate change.There has been some reforestation, through natural growth or planting, but trees need years to mature before they can fully absorb CO2.Over the past decade 4.7 million hectares of forest were still lost annually - with Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia among the countries worst affected.",-0.3230804464755914,"{'LOC': ['Brazil', 'Amazon', 'Brazil', 'Brazil', 'Amazon', 'Brazil', 'Amazon', 'Brazil', 'Brazil', 'Amazon', 'Bolivia', 'Bolivia', 'Congo', 'Democratic Republic of Congo', 'US', 'Indonesia', 'Brazil', 'Democratic Republic of Congo', 'Indonesia'], 'ORG': ['National Space Research Institute', 'INPE', 'Greenpeace', 'EU', 'Global Forest Watch', 'Greenpeace', 'Global Forest Watch', 'UN', 'UN'], 'PER': ['Jair Bolsonaro', 'Felix Tshisekedi', 'Joko Widodo', 'Widodo'], 'MISC': ['COP26']}","['Logs from the Amazon', 'Brazil deforestation', 'Bar chart showing top countries for forest loss', 'Bar chart showing annual forest loss in DR Congo', 'Bar chart showing annual forest loss in Indonesia', 'Indonesia deforestation', 'Bar chart showing total global forest loss annually 1990-2020', 'More on climate summit top strapline', 'More on Climate Change bottom strapline', 'Reality Check branding', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12391/production/_121314647_gettyimages-1174358838.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/12E1D/production/_121614377_brazil-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/38E2/production/_121326541_optimised-forest_loss-nc-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/0FE0/production/_121446040_dr_congo-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/102F3/production/_121319266_indonesia_v2-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15E5B/production/_121319698_gettyimages-452167534.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/DBE3/production/_121319265_deforestation_v4-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/163F9/production/_120892119_summit_top-3x-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/155C6/production/_120449478_bottom-3x.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1848/production/_98761260_onlinebanner_976x280.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_16_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_18.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_19.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_20.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_21.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_22.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_23.jpg', 'Images/link_16_image_24.jpg']"

BBC News",2021-11-03,COP26: What's the climate impact of private jets?,"There has been criticism of the number of world leaders and other delegates who have travelled to the COP26 summit in private jets.How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice?Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there.And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades.We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles, known as ""The Beast"", with him in Glasgow. He also had one in Rome on Sunday.FlightRadar24, which tracks flights, has looked at the number of non-commercial flights into Glasgow, Prestwick and Edinburgh airports since 27 October, excluding cargo, regular or local journeys.It has found that there were about 182 such flights, which is about double the total for the previous six days. That excludes some national chartered flights, such as President Biden's plane, Air Force One.Aviation analytics company Cirium told the BBC there was a total of 76 flights involving private jets, or VIP flights, arriving in and around Glasgow in the four days leading up to 1 November.Private jets have also been flying from Glasgow Airport, in Paisley, where they have dropped off passengers, to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, in Ayrshire, where they have been parking - a distance of about 41km.Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming.Emissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport.But this varies considerably depending on size, occupancy levels and efficiency. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights.There are many different models of private jet, but the Cessna Citation XLS - consistently one of the most popular - burns 189 gallons (857 litres) of aviation fuel an hour on average.If we were to consider the journey from Rome to Glasgow on a private jet - a journey that some of the G20 leaders made to get to COP 26 - that would take around two hours and 45 minutes, requiring 2,356 litres of jet fuel.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) says 2.52kg of carbon dioxide is emitted for every litre of aviation turbine fuel burned. Therefore this flight would produce 5.9 tonnes of CO2.However, BEIS recommends that to ""capture the maximum climate impact"" of flights, CO2 emissions figures should be multiplied by 1.9 to reflect the effect of non-CO2 emissions released by planes at high altitude, which, scientists say, increase the warming effect.Therefore, the total emissions for this flight would be 11.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and with a capacity of nine, each passenger would be responsible for 1.2 tonnes on their journey.If, however, our world leaders had decided to take a commercial flight from Rome to Glasgow their emissions would have been a quarter of a tonne each. Even though a commercial flight uses more fuel per hour, it is able to fly far more passengers than a private jet and therefore produces fewer emissions per person.""A huge amount of fuel is used during takeoff and landing of a plane, no matter how many people you have on board. So an already polluting mode of transport (commercial aviation) becomes even worse (with private jets),"" said Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert in decarbonising transport at University of Oxford.In April, US President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit for world leaders, at which some commitments were made.But several have been talking at this summit about the value of meeting in person.The president of Sierra Leone said: ""I have travelled extensively because I have to be there - we're talking about challenges and the environment in Sierra Leone. If I don't come here, how will they know?""UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said face-to-face talks were needed for ""crunch negotiations"" such as this.Another question being asked on social media is why the meeting of the G20 that happened right before COP26 had to be in Rome.The G20 is a group of big economies plus the European Union.It has a summit once a year, hosted by whichever country is holding the rotating presidency of the group.If COP26 had been in November 2020, as originally planned, it would have been followed by the G20 summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Update 3 November: The piece has been amended to change US gallons to UK gallons in the example of the Cessna plane.Read more about the COP26 summit here.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

12,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772,,2021-10-13,What is climate change? A really simple guide,"World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.We face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100.However, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.If nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species.Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods.With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.Wildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather.And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.Scientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken.Climate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts.If temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C.The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030.Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.Experts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.Major changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image from Getty Images.

13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58954530,,2021-10-25,Climate change: How do we know it is happening and caused by humans?,"Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change.But what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans?Our planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.The average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850. Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century.These conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites.Multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era.Scientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time.Tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate.This provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years.Greenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere.We can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy.Burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period.There's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature.Tree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - has risen significantly since 1850.Analysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm.Computer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.They reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate.Only when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.The level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us.Real-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:There have been several hot periods during the Earth's past.Around 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic.That should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities.There is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, the tropics could have become ""dead zones"", too hot for most species to survive.These fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Niño.For many years, groups of so-called climate ""sceptics"" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming.However, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.A key UN report released in 2021 said it ""is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land"".The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image credit: Getty Images.

BBC News",2019-08-09,Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint?,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming.But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer?To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.""What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,"" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.""It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,"" Poore explained.If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on 2018 figures from the Carbon Neutral Calculator. The Carbon Neutral Calculator is no longer online, but the methodology behind it can still be accessed.The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres.

16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58874518,,2021-11-04,What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?,"Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.They hope to achieve the target of ""net zero"" by 2050, to help slow global warming.Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises ""well below"" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Experts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050.Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.Almost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.Carbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution.This involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.However, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.It won't be easy.Reaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.Gas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps.Reaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.Presenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:The government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.At the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements ""a massive let-down"".More than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.However, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for ""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there.Russia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified.Until recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.US President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit.India - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070.Some of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.But many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.For instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production.But if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.There are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels.However, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage.And it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.",-0.3048630482272098,"{'MISC': ['COP26', 'Paris Agreement', 'Russian', 'Chinese', 'COP26', 'COP26', 'COP26'], 'LOC': ['Glasgow', 'UK', 'China', 'Russia', 'US', 'India', 'China', 'US', 'Indonesia', 'Glasgow'], 'ORG': ['House of Commons', 'EU', 'Country A'], 'PER': ['Ed Miliband', 'Putin', 'Joe Biden']}","['Cows walking between wind turbines in Norway', 'Chart showing major sources of greenhouse emissions in the UK', 'More on climate summit top strapline', 'More on Climate Change bottom strapline', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A458/production/_121127024_gettyimages-1327499341.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/EE90/production/_121127016_optimised-ukenergy-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/163F9/production/_120892119_summit_top-3x-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/155C6/production/_120449478_bottom-3x.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_22_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_22_image_18.jpg']"

You get a digger and just go for it.""Once the water found its way in, Ms Leonard explained ""nature just did its thing"".""We're really seeing the wildlife respond,"" she said.Prof William Austin from the University of St Andrews, who has been studying the site's natural restoration explained that ""allowing the sea to come back in"" created habitat and an opportunity to store what is known as blue carbon.""That's the carbon stored in plants and soils,"" he explained. ""These [saltmarshes] are places that will build up stores of carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.""We can count the plant species here, we can count the animals, we can look at the wading birds that start to come in and use the site,"" he told BBC News.""But as well as nature positive changes, we're starting to see an accumulation in the soil of organic material that is rich in carbon.

Environment reporter",2021-09-04,Then and now: Why deforestation is such a hot topic,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. For decades, deforestation has been seen as a leading cause of environmental damage. Now, the full cost that losing our tree cover is having on the world's climate is being realised, and politicians are taking notice.If there was a poster-child of environmental degradation, surely it is deforestation.The removal of trees - for example, through logging or fires - has, for many decades, been listed as one of the main factors behind nature loss and environmental harm.In recent years, the loss of tree cover around the world has also been firmly linked to the increasingly volatile changes to the climate.Plants and trees absorb up to a third of our CO2 emissions from the atmosphere each year. Yet, as we fell vast swathes of primary forests around the globe, we are reducing our planet's ability to lock away, or sequester, the harmful gas that is released from burning fossil fuels.According to the UN, an estimated 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost through conversion to other land uses since 1990 - that is an area roughly equivalent to the size of Libya.However, campaigns to protect forests have had an impact during the past three decades. UN data suggests the rate of deforestation between 2015 and 2020 was an estimated 10 million hectares per year, down from 16 million hectares per year in the 1990s.While the issue of deforestation is taken very seriously at a global level, the implementation of strategies and policies to reduce deforestation ultimately rests with national governments.At this level, the track record is much more patchy. For example, Brazil - for a succession of governments - seemed to be heeding international advice and deforestation rates had been falling steadily since 2004.However, scientists writing in Nature journal last year listed the Brazilian Amazon deforestation rate for the previous 12 months as the highest in a decade.Campaigners said the deforestation rate had accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil's president in 2019. They said Mr Bolsonaro's policy of favouring agriculture and mining within the Amazon rainforest was to blame.It illustrates that international efforts to protect these valuable habitats are meaningless unless there is support from national governments.In recent years, trees have become a well-trodden solution for policymakers grappling with the threat posed by climate change.The ability of trees to sequester carbon is a very popular topic within the political arena. They are a well-known facet of the global carbon cycle, removing millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.Therefore, policies that promote and encourage the planting of hundreds of thousands of trees are billed as a vital part of the shift to sustainability, and a key part of the solutions-based approach to tackling the climate crisis facing the planet.However, there are a number of potential hurdles or limitations.Firstly, can we be sure that we are planting more trees than we are losing?Are the new saplings being offered enough protection to ensure they make it to being mature specimens? It is only once that a tree reaches maturity so that it can fully absorb CO2 - on average, about 21kg each year.What species are being planted to sequester carbon? Are they fast-growing or slow-growing? How long do they live? What happens when they die? Will the timber be used for materials and construction or will it be left to rot, releasing the carbon it had locked away from the atmosphere?It has also been identified in a number of studies in urban areas that tree planting schemes are struggling to keep up with the number of trees felled in the name of development.Secondly, as only mature trees can make a meaningful contribution to sequestering carbon, it will take many decades for a sapling to reach maturity.Therefore, the trees we are planting today will only be making a meaningful difference to the volume of CO2 in our atmosphere in half a century's time.A famous Chinese saying suggests that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.However, it adds, the second best time is today - so there is still hope.As another popular saying states: better late than never.",0.0257707187107631,"{'MISC': ['Then and Now', 'Brazilian', 'Chinese'], 'ORG': ['UN', 'UN'], 'LOC': ['Libya', 'Brazil', 'Brazil', 'Amazon'], 'PER': ['Jair Bolsonaro', 'Bolsonaro']}","[""Brazil's deforestation in charts"", 'Smoke billows during a fire in an area of the Amazon rainforest near Porto Velho, Rondonia State, Brazil, September 10, 2019.', 'An aerial view of a deforested plot of the Amazon at the Bom Futuro National Forest in Porto Velho, Rondonia State, Brazil, September 3, 2015', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/ED5C/production/_115746706_optimised-amazongdp-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9383/production/_115736773_hi064132541-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1CC4/production/_115746370_mediaitem115692680.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_24_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_24_image_17.jpg']"

fuel combustion account for almost a quarter of CO2 emissions from human activities.So the impact of lockdowns on transport around the globe in the Covid-19 pandemic has been stark.According to the International Energy Agency, average activity on the world's roads fell by almost 50% compared with 2019.The improvement in air quality was clear to see.In a short space of time, urban areas were recording massive reductions in a range of pollutants associated with internal combustion engines.Data collected by the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science shows marked reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and in particulate matter (PM2.5) across 10 cities.In India, people took to social media to post images of clear skies after an estimated 90% of road journeys stopped during the lockdown.Speaking in April, Sunil Dahiya from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air told BBC News: ""The current crisis has shown us that clear skies and breathable air can be achieved very fast if concrete action is taken to reduce burning of fossil fuels.""However, as quickly as air quality improved during lockdowns, so it appears to have returned to normal just as fast once lockdowns were eased or lifted.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the global response to the Covid-19 crisis has had little impact on the continued rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO2.Carbon emissions did fall dramatically as lockdowns cut transport and industry sharply.But data from the WMO showed that it had only marginally slowed the overall rise in concentrations.The details were published in the WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin.During the lockdowns, there were widespread calls for the environmental benefits to be maintained.Proponents said it was essential that economic growth after the pandemic focused on following a low emission, sustainable path.Despite calls to build back greener, it seems as if the priority has been business as usual, regardless of cost.Our

Environment reporter",2021-03-04,Then and now: A 'megadrought' in California,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of extreme weather on a crucial reservoir that supplies water to millions of people in northern California.This year is likely to be critically dry for California. Winter storms that dumped heavy snow and rain across the state are not expected to be substantial enough to counterbalance drought conditions.Lake Oroville plays a key role in California's complex water delivery system.This 65km-square body of water north of Sacramento is the second-largest reservoir in California.Not only does Lake Oroville store water, it helps control flooding elsewhere in the region, assists with the maintenance of water quality and boosts the health of fisheries downstream.In 2014, more than 80% of California was in the grip of an ""extreme drought"". Against this backdrop, Oroville's capacity fell to 30% - a historic low level.As the water level receded to hundreds of feet below normal levels, ramps and roads no longer reached the water's edge.More worryingly, the reservoir - when full - provided enough water for an estimated seven million households, as well as providing power for hydroelectricity facilities and irrigation for agricultural land.The dry conditions didn't start in 2014, however, there had been a drought for years prior to Oroville recording its historic low level.Indeed, the US space agency's Earth Observatory had warned that the multi-year drought was having a wider impact on the region. Among its effects was a contribution to ""unusually active and destructive"" fire seasons and poor yields from agricultural land.""There is strong evidence from climate models and centuries of tree ring data that suggest about one-third to one-half of the severity of the current drought can be attributed to climate change,"" observed Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist from Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.Agency scientists added that the data suggested a ""megadrought"" might already be underway in this region - and that it could last for decades.The latest update from the US Drought Monitor in December 2020, showed that much of the country's western states were gripped by extreme or exceptional drought, with Nevada, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, Colorado and western Texas being the worst affected.The Drought Monitor releases maps showing the parts of the country with prolonged shortages in the water supply. It is produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).Climate change is not just about a warmer world, it also means that the planet will see more extreme environmental conditions and weather. So, for example, episodes of flooding will increase, as well as episodes of droughts.Lake Oroville was a perfect illustration of how these extremes can threaten our existing infrastructure.While the lake's levels reached a historic low in 2014, the reservoir's vast embankment dam - the tallest in the US - was pushed to breaking point in February 2017.Following fierce storms in the surrounding mountains, water was flowing into the lake at a rate of roughly one-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools each second.Communities downstream had been evacuated, with more than 100,000 people being ordered to leave their homes.Officials were struggling to allow water to flow out of the lake because the main spillway - a structure that provides controlled releases of water - and the emergency spillway had been eroded and damaged.Yet they had to continue sending water down the valley because the reservoir was reaching capacity and there was a sense that there could be a ""catastrophic failure"" in the structure.In the space of two years, the lake went from an unprecedented low to a capacity that had not been experienced before. Water cascaded over the emergency spillways, which had not previously been required.Traditionally, the lake was replenished by meltwater from a thawing snowpack in surrounding mountains, whose river systems fed the reservoir. June was the month when the reservoir was expected to reach its yearly maximum level.However, in 2017, it was rain that caused the intense water flow. The reservoir had reached capacity in February, rather than the middle of the year, as usually happened.Scientists again suggested that the event fitted into the paradigm of a warming world.Speaking at the time to the Guardian newspaper, Prof Roger Bale, from the University of California Merced, explained: ""With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.""The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that the ""frequency and intensity of droughts, storms and extreme weather events are increasingly likely above 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels)"".Failure to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5C, as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is likely to result in more of the world's reservoirs or flood defences being tested to breaking point.This is a stark warning for world leaders, who will be gathering once again this year at the UN's annual climate summit (COP26) - to be held in Glasgow.The meeting, which had to be postponed by a year because of Covid, will seek to raise global ambition on tackling climate change - with a view to keeping temperature rise within the 1.5C limit.Our Planet Then and Now will continue up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is due to start in November 2021",-0.194623473443483,"{'MISC': ['Then and Now', 'Olympic-size'], 'LOC': ['California', 'California', 'Lake Oroville', 'California', 'Sacramento', 'California', 'Lake Oroville', 'California', 'US', 'New York', 'Nevada', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'New Mexico', 'Colorado', 'Texas', 'Lake Oroville', 'US', 'Paris', 'Glasgow', 'Glasgow'], 'ORG': ['Oroville', 'Earth Observatory', 'Goddard Institute for Space Studies', 'US Drought Monitor', 'Drought Monitor', 'National Drought Mitigation Center', 'NDMC', 'University of Nebraska-Lincoln', 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'Noaa', 'US Department of Agriculture', 'USDA', 'Guardian', 'University of California Merced', 'United Nations Environment Programme', 'Unep', 'UN', 'UN'], 'PER': ['Benjamin Cook', 'Roger Bale']}","['Infographic - US drought conditions', 'The damaged spillway and the eroded hillside at the Oroville Dam', 'Map of northern California', 'California Department of Water Resources staff monitoring the water flowing through the damaged spillway on Friday 10 February', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/060A/production/_117364510_us_drought_map_x2_640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0336/production/_94622800_5f1cbc51-1ec5-42fe-94d3-f1a07d9b856f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1512A/production/_117341368_ef3ad828-55e7-4421-988e-e22fc457e22f.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/102EA/production/_117328266_43248a98-1dce-4eea-ba4d-24149bdb17da.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_26_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_26_image_18.jpg']"

Environment reporter",2021-05-01,Then and now: When silence descended over Victoria Falls,"In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of global heating on Victoria Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world - and how Sub-Saharan Africa is learning to cope with the climate crisis.In full flow, Victoria Falls easily qualifies as one of the natural wonders of the world. Spanning 1.7km at its widest point and with a height of more than 100m, locals refer to Africa's greatest waterfall as ""the smoke that thunders"".This amazing feature is formed as the Zambezi river plunges into a chasm called the First Gorge. The chasm was carved by the action of water along a natural fracture zone in the volcanic rock that makes up the landscape in this region of southern Africa.In 2019, however, Victoria Falls was silenced.In a drought described as the worst in a century, the flow of the Zambezi was reduced to a relative trickle and the Falls ran dry.As one of the region's biggest attractions for tourists, Victoria Falls is a valuable source of income for Zimbabwe and Zambia. As news of the low waters spread, local traders noticed a visible drop in tourist numbers.As well as hitting the countries' economies, it also hit electricity supplies, which are dependent on hydroelectric generation.More widely across the region, agencies reported an increase in the need for food aid, as crops failed in the drought.A single extreme weather event cannot, in isolation, be viewed as a consequence of climate change.But the region is recording a sequence of extreme droughts that reflect what climate modellers have predicted will occur as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere as a result of human activity.Zambia's President, Edgar Lungu - speaking at the time - called it ""a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment"".Observers of weather patterns in the Zambezi Basin believe the changing climate is resulting in a delay to the monsoon season, concentrating the rains into bigger, more intense events.This makes the storage of the water in the region more difficult, and makes the impact of the extended dry season more damaging to people and the environment.The UN's State of the Climate in Africa in 2019 report painted a worrying picture for a continent that could see its population double over the coming century.Speaking at the report's launch in October 2020, World Meteorological Organization secretary-general Petteri Taalas observed: ""Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent, hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources.""In recent months, we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert locusts and now face the looming spectre of drought because of a La Niña event.""The report adds that 2019 was among the three warmest years on record for the continent.It warns that the warming trend is expected to continue.The worrying fact facing politicians, policymakers and civil society is that the continent is set to be hardest hit by climate change, yet the continent's capacity to adapt to the realities of a warming world are low.Areas of concern include water supplies, health, food security, droughts and floods, biodiversity. It is a list of concerns that is continuing to grow.Africa is on the front line of the battle against dangerous climate change.Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021",0.2036000704765319,"{'MISC': ['Then and Now', 'African'], 'LOC': ['Victoria Falls', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Victoria Falls', 'Africa', 'Africa', 'Victoria Falls', 'Zambezi', 'Victoria Falls', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zambia', 'Zambia', 'Africa', 'Glasgow'], 'PER': ['Edgar Lungu', 'Petteri Taalas'], 'ORG': ['UN', 'State of the Climate in Africa', 'World Meteorological Organization', 'UN']}","['Someone standing in a dried up river in northern Kenya', 'Victoria Falls', 'An aerial shot of an area around Beira under water in Mozambique following Cyclone Idai', 'Star Hobson', 'Alison Stitt', 'Booster vaccine being given', 'Dayjanta Samuels', 'Spider-Man', ""Verstappen and Hamilton's race cars side-by-side"", 'Kentucky aftermath', 'Ralph Ragnick', 'Cait Wilde', 'The Terror', 'The Northern Bank Job', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1555/production/_110116450_gettyimages-93066205.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FDDB/production/_118278946_48d6e4a1-c4be-472d-b515-88db446375fa-2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13AC7/production/_106138508_afp_un_moz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1FD3/production/_122074180_photo09-12-2021223741-6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/118D0/production/_122088817_alisonstitt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5269/production/_122079012_gettyimages-1237092186.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/5621/production/_121594022_mediaitem121594021.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11D79/production/_122218037_spider-man_nowayhome_m31853.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B41C/production/_122080164_p0b9t21p.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/A0E4/production/_122088114_gettyimages-1237198998.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/365B/production/_122051931_rangnick_getty_index.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/842E/production/_121983833_caitpretreatment.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/174DE/production/_117545459_theterror.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/15CA3/production/_122015298_thenorthernbankjob.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0911x39.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p02v0hjz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09x4hz0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p06jbczg.jpg']","['Images/link_27_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_27_image_17.jpg']"

BBC Monitoring",2021-12-15,The teenagers and the nun trying to stop an Australian coal mine,"When eight teenagers and an elderly nun in Australia teamed up for a climate case, they won, in a historic judgement. Their case has now been appealed by the country's government. If the final verdict swings in their favour, it will have ramifications not just for Australian law but for climate cases world-wide.In May this year, Anjali Sharma was sitting in her economics class at school in Melbourne when the court in Sydney live-streamed the results of a climate case she had found herself at the centre of. It took a while to sink in.""To me it all just sounded like jargon. It took a briefing from my legal team to understand the magnitude of what had happened,"" she says.At that moment 17-year-old Ms Sharma and the seven other teenagers involved in her case had made history. Alongside 87-year-old Catholic nun Brigid Arthur, who acted as the young people's legal guardian, they'd taken Australia's environment minister, Sussan Ley, to court - and won.""It felt really rewarding to be able to engage in something so historic for Australia, and needed too,"" says Ms Sharma.Their case attempted to stop the expansion of the Vickery coal mine in New South Wales, which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere.The judge in their case, Mordy Bromberg, ruled that the government had a duty to protect young people against future harm related to climate change. It's the first time in the world that a duty of care of this kind has been recognised.Justice Bromberg did not, however, grant them an injunction to prevent the expansion of the mine. In his view, the court didn't have any evidence that Sussan Ley would actually approve the extension, and any injunction would be pre-emptive.Yet in September Ms Ley approved the extension of the Vickery coal mine, as well as three others since then. The government is also appealing the decision in the Sharma case - the outcome of which is due soon.The government used a ""substitution argument"" as one reason to approve Vickery, says the lawyer representing the Sharma case, David Barnden.""It's the argument that if this particular coal project didn't go ahead, it wouldn't make a difference to the total amount of emissions because effectively the market would fulfill that demand. That's otherwise known as the drug dealer's defence - it's the idea that 'If I don't deal drugs then somebody else will.'""For Sister Brigid Arthur, the minister's decisions since the success of their case are ""quite provocative"".Sister Arthur has spent a lifetime working with young people. For over two decades she has been acting as a litigation guardian - instructing lawyers on behalf of those who can't represent themselves - in cases mostly involving refugees. Before that she was a secondary school teacher. This is her first environmental case.""It's engaged young people in a way that seems quite extraordinary. It's certainly for me something new,"" she says.She was approached by lawyers just over a year ago who asked her to act as the teenagers' litigation guardian. She didn't take much convincing.""I'm pretty passionate about climate change and while I don't work directly in this area, I'm very conscious of the fact that it's important for people to do what they can.""Young people are the ones who will inherit whatever we're doing now, so they have every right to be calling people to account.""In speaking out, Ms Sharma has made herself a target for attacks.""I've been messaged a lot of threats,"" she says.""Some of the big news sources in Australia have, I guess, quite a right-wing following, so when news sources like that have covered my story I learned really quickly not to read the comments.""A 2019 report which investigated four publications owned by Australia's most powerful media company, News Corp Australia, argued that they promoted climate scepticism. Of over 8,000 articles analysed, 45% of all items either rejected or cast doubt upon consensus scientific findings.In response, a News Corp Australia spokesman said the year-old report was ""imbalanced"" and coming from ""a political activist group with a history of bias against our company's journalism"".News Corp Australia recently has been viewed as softening its hostility towards climate action by advocating for net zero emissions by 2050.Despite this, shortly before and during COP26, videos from News Corp-owned Sky News Australia were recycled and found traction on social media amongst climate sceptics.One Sky News Australia segment in which the host condemns youth climate activists as ""selfish, badly educated, virtue-signalling little turds"" was shared by the head of the advocacy group the CO2 coalition and received over 45,000 likes and 16,000 retweets.As the science of climate change has become harder to argue with, a growing and common tactic is often to shoot the messenger instead - often accusing them of hypocrisy.""Comments like 'Oh, she's wearing jeans and I bet she doesn't know how much water goes into producing a pair of jeans,'"" says Ms Sharma. ""And you know, they're right. I do own a pair of jeans. But me not owning that pair of jeans is not going to cut Australia's emissions in half by 2030.""When Sister Brigid first met the teenagers, who knew each other through attending climate protests, she was struck by their passion. She describes them as a group of young people ""who really believe in this, who feel like they can't stop"".""There are very few greys with young people,"" she says. ""Everything is so black and white.""But for now, all they can do is wait for the result of the appeal to be announced.Despite widespread recognition of the need to move away from coal, there are different approaches when it comes to putting that knowledge into practice. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, coal became a point of contention after delegates from China and India requested a last-minute change to the agreement, switching the phrase ""phase out"" coal with ""phase down"".The results of the appeal and their case could be game-changing - not only for Australia but for other parts of the world too.A success in their case could signal an erosion in support for fossil fuel burning and extraction with more lawsuits of this kind ahead. But if the minister's appeal is successful, it could see courts effectively vacate the climate field.Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of coal. Following the Glasgow summit, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the coal industry will be operating in the country for ""decades to come"". He added that the plan to achieve net zero by 2050 will not come at the cost of rural and regional Australians.""The world is grappling with this collective action problem of climate change. Every mine has its part to play and every decision counts,"" says Mr Barnden.""What the court found was that the emissions from this particular extension project could be the emissions that tip us over the edge to these nonlinear tipping points which would further accelerate climate change.""He hopes that the duty of care ruling - if maintained through the appeal process - can influence other jurisdictions and give hope to young people to be able to participate in the legal process.""It's a very foundational legal case to approach the problems caused by climate change, and the principles of negligence exist in a whole range of common law countries, from the UK, to New Zealand, Canada and the US as well.""It's too soon to tell whether this case will provide a turning point on climate inaction. But for Ms Sharma and the other teenagers involved in her case, the time for action is now.""I really hope the federal court realises that Australia is now running behind the rest of the world, and that the duty of care that my case seeks to establish is really, really needed right now.""",0.1224127054214477,"{'LOC': ['Australia', 'Melbourne', 'Sydney', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Vickery', 'New South Wales', 'Vickery', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Glasgow', 'China', 'India', 'Australia', 'Australia', 'Glasgow', 'UK', 'New Zealand', 'Canada', 'US', 'Australia'], 'MISC': ['Australian', 'Catholic', 'COP26', 'Australian', 'Australians.'], 'PER': ['Anjali Sharma', 'Brigid Arthur', 'Sussan Ley', 'Ms Sharma', 'Mordy Bromberg', 'Justice Bromberg', 'Sussan Ley', 'Vickery', 'Sharma', 'David Barnden.', 'Brigid Arthur', 'Arthur', 'Sharma', 'Brigid', 'Scott Morrison', 'Barnden.'], 'ORG': ['News Corp Australia', 'News Corp Australia', 'News Corp Australia', 'News Corp-owned Sky News Australia', 'CO2']}","['Sister Brigid Arthur and Anjali Sharma outside the federal court in Melbourne with their lawyer David Barnden', 'Environment minister Sussan Ley', 'Anjali Sharma', '2px presentational grey line', '2px presentational grey line', ""Australia is the world's second largest exporter of coal"", 'Couple looking worried about bills', 'Worried man in mask looks at computer', 'Chloe', 'Promo image showing UK', 'Rats scavenging for food', 'Helen (left) and Mary Akande (right)', 'Anjali Sharma', 'Katie Fields father', 'Downing Street', 'Greg Lake', 'The Battersea Poltergeist', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/101B0/production/_121986956_b8af69c5-0dc7-4193-85c4-3b5530ef07c8.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4039/production/_121914461_gettyimages-1310017393.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/446E/production/_122081571_anj2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16B7/production/_122051850_coalaustralia.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1BCE/production/_117381170_housing.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/6633/production/_122236162_whatsubject.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/F518/production/_122244726_p0bbg1wn.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B179/production/_119333454_coronavirus_lookup_index_promo-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/112DF/production/_122076307_tworattusgettyimages-525973077.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/1ABB/production/_122234860_whatsappimage2021-12-15at14.13.23.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/B99E/production/_122081574_anj2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/97CF/production/_122236883_p0bb8s6g.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/E847/production/_122236495_p0bb9drz.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/CDC6/production/_121987625_greglake.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/A5C0/production/_116623424_thebatterseapoltergeist.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0b8g8p3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0b6jpcl.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p09n6r2j.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0b9r3bc.jpg']","['Images/link_0_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_18.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_19.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_20.jpg']"

Climate change disinformation specialist",2021-12-24,Climate change: Small army of volunteers keeping deniers off Wikipedia,"Wikipedia has for so long been plagued by climate change denial. But a group of dedicated volunteers around the world is working tirelessly to keep the deniers at bay.David Tetta lives in northern California, in the kind of close-knit community where neighbours just wander into each other's homes - during our interview, he breaks off for a second to shoo one of them out of the room.It was while chatting to his neighbours that David first thought of volunteering to edit Wikipedia. In 2019, around the time wildfires were raging across the state, climate change was coming up more and more often as a topic.""Many conversations seemed to evolve into people expressing their feelings of angst and fear about the environment,"" he says.""I was wondering, what kind of information are people getting?""David was well-placed to study the subject, having worked for the US Environmental Protection Agency for more than 30 years.He looked at the most obvious starting point for climate change information, Wikipedia - and, as he diplomatically puts it, he found ""certain areas of it that could be improved"".He started small by proposing edits and discussing them with other volunteers. But he soon found himself pouring hundreds of hours into Wikipedia editing.""You have to read through about 100 pages of scientific information to edit a sentence,"" he says.English Wikipedia alone gets more than nine billion page views a month, and the magnitude of that figure is not lost on David.""It gives you a certain sense of responsibility for making sure you're getting it right.""The point of Wikipedia is that anyone with an internet connection can edit it. But that also makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and those who deny the climate crisis know it.They've been waging an editing war to get their views across, and subtlety is not always their forte.On one occasion, someone added a sentence wrongly suggesting climate scientists worldwide are in the pocket of a secretive Communist organisation.Another user peppered paragraphs with the word ""alleged"", wrongly suggesting that basic climate science is far less settled than you might think.And, in a rather mischievous twist, one time the entire text of an article on climate change was turned into a hyperlink. Users clicking on any of it would immediately be taken to an article about hoaxes.Those kinds of stunts don't last long, though.""That might stay up for a few minutes or an hour or so,"" David says. ""But usually, one of the editors will spot it.""David is part of a small but dedicated group of volunteers who have made it their mission to curate and protect articles about climate change on English Wikipedia. And they're not afraid to pick a fight.""I'll send [the deniers] a note on their personal page on Wikipedia saying, 'This is vandalism, this could have consequences,'"" says David. ""Sometimes these people get kicked off Wikipedia.""Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, has grown into one of the world's most popular websites, and is published in more than 300 different languages.English Wikipedia is the largest version - and, according to the editors interviewed for this piece, the one where you can find the most reliable coverage of climate change.""We are lucky with a large editor base,"" says Dutch volunteer Femke Nijsse.She's come to be regarded as one of the most influential voices within the small community of Wikipedia editors specialising in climate change.If you have ever visited the main Wikipedia article on climate change, chances are that you read some of Femke's words - she's the user who's contributed the most to that article by far.""I'm quite proud of my work on Wikipedia,"" she says.Femke is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter, studying the transition to green energy - so global warming is something she's been thinking about for a while.She's been editing Wikipedia articles for seven years and in that time she's got to know what junk science looks like.""Editors recognise all of the common climate denial myths, and most editors have a good feeling for misinformation red flags, including use of unreliable sources, of emotive words,"" she says.""The most satisfying editing for me is the removal of misinformation.""Femke is clinical in her debunking of bad science, and a stickler for Wikipedia's rules.In October, a user tried to add a sentence to the climate change article, wrongly suggesting that stopping the world from using fossil fuels would make no difference to global warming. Femke dismissed the edit, but not before explaining that such a statement would have to be backed by reliable sources.Wikipedia doesn't have a policy vetoing climate change denial, but there are policies that insist you have to cite quality sources, which tends to weed unscientific content out.""Wikipedia is just an uncomfortable place to be if you want to promote a point of view that goes against science,"" says volunteer editor Su-Laine Brodsky, a tech writer by profession. ""It's much easier to be on social media, where you can say whatever you want, and not really be held to task for it.""From her home in Canada, Su-Laine has been editing Wikipedia pages for 15 years.She started out by sharing medical information and moved on to writing about sea otters and killer whales. She only recently decided to focus on climate pages.""I've always been interested in the environment and wildlife, and was kind of intimidated by the idea of working on climate change,"" she says. ""I thought of climate change as a very technical and very controversial topic.""But one day she stumbled across an article on sustainable energy that was riddled with problems. ""It had a lot of self-promotion - companies promoting themselves, people who are doing some kind of research promoting their pet project.""Su-Laine got stuck in and started getting rid of it.""Wikipedians are people who fix things,"" she says. ""You notice something that's wrong, and you just need to have enough confidence to say, 'I can make this suck a bit less.'""Sometimes the errors are obvious. But it didn't take long for Su-Laine to realise some users were twisting the facts in subtler ways, especially in less-trafficked articles.""When you've got an article about a climate science denier, people will try to soften that by saying so-and-so is a 'climate policy analyst'. That's a way of making the person sound more credible,"" she says.According to Alex Stinson from the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, climate misinformation ranges from neglect - science that's out of date - to a lack of balance, to active disinformation.He's confident the organisation has what it takes to deal with the problem.""All of the studies on vandalism and misinformation suggest that our natural immune system on the big language Wikipedias catches something like 97% of it rapidly,"" he says.As well as human editors, the organisation also uses computer bots to fight vandalism. High-profile articles, including some about climate, also benefit from additional layers of protection - some of them can only be edited by users with a certain amount of editing experience.But there will always be areas of the website that are harder to patrol.""There are over 6,300,000 articles on English Wikipedia,"" Alex says. ""Not all of those are under the same kind of universal scrutiny of the community.""And bad information, even outright conspiracies theories, are more common on climate pages in languages other than English, according to a recent BBC investigation.For now, it is entirely down to volunteers to hold the fort.""Wikipedia is uneven,"" says Su-Laine. ""You have to still take it with a grain of salt.""",-0.2739532576050869,"{'PER': ['David Tetta', 'David', 'David', 'David.', 'David', 'David', 'David', 'Femke Nijsse', 'Femke', 'Femke', 'Femke', 'Femke', 'Su-Laine Brodsky', 'Su-Laine', 'Su-Laine', 'Su-Laine', 'Alex Stinson', 'Alex', 'Su-Laine'], 'LOC': ['California', 'Canada'], 'MISC': ['Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'English Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Communist', 'English Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'English Wikipedia', 'Dutch', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedia', 'Wikipedias', 'English', 'English'], 'ORG': ['US Environmental Protection Agency', 'University of Exeter', 'Wikimedia Foundation']}","['Photo of Wikipedia volunteer David Tetta', 'Photo of Wikipedia volunteer Femke Nijsse', 'Photo of Wikipedia volunteer Su-Laine Brodsky', 'The Denial Files branding - a planet with headphones on a background of fire', 'Daniel Craig', 'Christmas party', 'swimmers taking the plunge during the annual Christmas swim in Weymouth, Cornwall, UK', 'Ray Illingworth', 'Reindeer in Finland', 'Jess Boyes', 'The cold weather began in December ‘81', 'Maeve Henry and her husband Adam', 'Hannah Hall', 'Gavin and Stacey', 'Spider Man', '', '', '', '']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D827/production/_121853355_davidtetta2_cropped.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16B2F/production/_122257929_img_0420_cropped.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12647/production/_121853357_sulaine1_cropped.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/126B7/production/_121474457_the-denial-files-16-9-hi-res.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/F19B/production/_121215816_craigepa.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/6C4A/production/_121922772_gettyimages-1177891192.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/F578/production/_122504826_gettyweymouth.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/172C/production/_111423950_ray_illingworth_getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/CFC1/production/_122358135_reindeer_fin_getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/11B9E/production/_122360627_mediaitem122360626.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/14BFC/production/_122488948_p0bcshn0.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/51CC/production/_122004902_maeve.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/385/cpsprodpb/D2B5/production/_122314935_20211214_095545.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/F513/production/_121893726_g-s.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/480/cpsprodpb/46BA/production/_122260181_spidermanfilm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p07xp0h4.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p07y5vvr.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p0bb72v5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240x135/p091sm1c.jpg']","['Images/link_0_image_0.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_1.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_2.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_3.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_4.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_5.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_6.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_7.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_8.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_9.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_10.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_11.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_12.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_13.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_14.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_15.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_16.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_17.jpg', 'Images/link_0_image_18.jpg']"
